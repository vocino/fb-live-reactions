# Facebook Live Reactions

A simple Jekyll build designed to be used in conjunction with OBS's CLR browser to display real time reactions on Facebook Live streams.

I designed this for use on my [Vocino.com](https://facebook.com/vocinocom) page and my [Travis Vocino](https://facebook.com/vocino) profile.
